# malware-detection-using-machine-learning
Malware are considered as the malicious software program which infects the normal working of the PCs or Mobile. The concept of machine learning is utilized in the detection of the malwares, various sub-approaches like the ANN, CNN etc. are used by various researchers for the detection purpose. In this project, we explore the various different types of the models which are used by various researchers in the malware detection thereby highlighting the accuracy of these models.
